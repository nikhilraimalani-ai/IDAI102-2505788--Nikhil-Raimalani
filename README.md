  The Satirical CO₂ Emission Calculator is a humorous, interactive Streamlit app that estimates the carbon footprint of everyday purchases. Users enter basic detais item name, category, price, weight, shipping distance, and delivery speed and the app computes an approximate CO₂ emission using simplified but more realistic emission factors. 

Satirical CO₂ Emission Calculator

A humorous, Streamlit-based carbon-footprint calculator that judges your shopping habits with sarcasm, snark, and (slightly) scientific math.

About the Project

The Satirical CO₂ Emission Calculator estimates the carbon footprint of your purchases based on category, price, quantity, weight, shipping distance, and delivery speed. It uses simplified—but more realistic—emission factors and applies distance multipliers, weight influence, and shipping-speed penalties.

Instead of giving you a dry climate report, this app delivers:

Sarcastic feedback based on your purchase’s carbon intensity

Context-aware sustainability tips that change every run

Fun comparisons (car kilometers, tree-years, phone charges)

A session history so you can track all your questionable decisions

Features

🛒 CO₂ estimation for a wide range of product categories

😏 Randomized sarcastic messages

🌱 Realistic(ish) sustainability tips tailored to category + shipping choices

📦 Weight & shipping impact included

📊 Friendly emissions equivalents

📜 Session-based purchase history


This project is satirical. Emission values are simplified for educational and comedic purposes, not for formal carbon auditing.
